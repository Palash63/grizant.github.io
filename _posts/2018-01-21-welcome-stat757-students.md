At times, I'll use the blog/posting feature of this website to provide announcements. So please check regularly for updates.

The course website is located here: [www.grantschissler.com/teaching/SP18/STAT757/](http://www.grantschissler.com/teaching/SP18/STAT757/) or finding the link in the teaching section of this website by clicking the button above.

Here is a bit of R code to pique your interest:

{% highlight R %}
print("Hello STAT 757 students.")
#=> prints [1] "Hello STAT 757 students" to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
